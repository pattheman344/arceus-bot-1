# Arceus Bot - Open Sourced

## This was one of my first discord bots I made, it's simple but does the job for moderation discords.

# HOW TO INSTALL

## Installation of discord.py

Go into your command prompt, and type in "pip install discord.py", this will install discord.py.

## Installing the other Modules for this bot

Go into your command prompt once again, and then write the following commands:

### pip install random
### pip install praw
### pip install requests
### pip install json
### pip install asyncio

# Huge credits to sauce#0002, he helped me in some of the commands like the reddit memes command.
